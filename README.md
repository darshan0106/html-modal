# Modal Popup

Welcome to the Modal Popup repository! This project contains a JavaScript code snippet for displaying a modal popup on a web page. The modal popup provides a user-friendly way to present additional information or interact with users without navigating away from the current page.

## About the Code

The provided JavaScript code snippet implements the functionality for showing and hiding a modal popup. Let's break down the key components of the code:

- **Modal Elements**: The code references the modal and overlay elements using `document.querySelector()` to fetch them from the HTML document.

- **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are attached to multiple elements to trigger the display and hiding of the modal. Here's what each event listener does:
  - For each button with the class `show-modal`, a click event listener is added. When clicked, it removes the `hidden` class from both the modal and overlay elements, making them visible.
  - The close button inside the modal (with the class `close-modal`) has a click event listener that adds the `hidden` class back to both the modal and overlay, hiding them from view.
  - Clicking on the overlay outside the modal triggers a similar action, hiding the modal and overlay.
  - Additionally, a keydown event listener is added to the entire document. If the 'Escape' key is pressed and the modal is currently visible (i.e., it does not contain the `hidden` class), the modal and overlay are hidden.

- **Strict Mode**: The code begins with the `'use strict';` directive, which enables strict mode. Strict mode helps catch common coding mistakes and makes JavaScript more secure by enforcing stricter rules.

## How to Use

To incorporate this modal popup functionality into your project, follow these steps:

1. Add the HTML structure for the modal and overlay elements to your HTML document.

2. Add the provided JavaScript code snippet to your JavaScript file or script tag in your HTML document.

3. Ensure that the modal and overlay elements have appropriate CSS styles to control their appearance and position on the page.

4. Customize the modal content, styling, and behavior according to your project requirements.

## Customization

You can customize the modal popup in various ways, including:
- Modifying the CSS styles to change the appearance and layout of the modal and overlay.
- Adding animations or transitions to enhance the visual effects when showing or hiding the modal.
- Incorporating additional functionality, such as form validation or dynamic content loading, into the modal popup.
